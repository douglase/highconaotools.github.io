sciencefocus: High Contrast Imaging Technology Development

environment: HCIT is a ISO 7 clean room (class 10000), with three optical tables. The optical tables are sits on Minus K's Passive Mechanical Vibration Isolators inside two vacuum chamber. The Chambers provide a space-like test environment (turbulence free and thermally stable). Each table has a supercontinuum laser sources, remote actuation and selection of optical elements, deformable mirrors, thermal sensors, local thermal control loops, silicon CCD/CMOS sensors and one of the tables has an Integrated Field Spectrometer as well.
