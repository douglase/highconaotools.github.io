environment: In air, active vibration isolation, passive thermal isolation (double enclosure).
hardwareitems:
- 1: "Light Source: HOT possesses two independent light generating sources: a helium neon laser for alignment purposes and a halogen lamp for experiments. The light sources feed into the turbulence generator via optical fibers using either SMA or FC connectors."
- 2: "Turbulence Generator: An integral part of HOT is the Turbulence Generator. Turbulence is generated using two reflective phase screens with a diameter of 5.0 cm each. They are installed on rotating mounts, which turn in different directions and at adjustable speeds."
- 3: "Alpao DM: The ALPAO 52-actuator deformable mirror (DM52) is a discrete actuator deformable mirror, composed of a set of magnets attached to a thin mirror membrane used primarily for low -order wavefront aberrations."
- 4: "Boston Micromachines DM: The BMM has 1024 actuators in a 32 x 32 grid and is used for correcting high-order wavefront aberrations. It is installed on a customized board and connected to a electronics high voltage amplifier using 16 cables, with two cables per high voltage board. The high voltage electronics are driven through the real time computing SPARTA platform, developed to control the next generation of ESO adaptive optics systems."
- 5: "Shack-Hartmann WFS: The Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHS), developed by the university of Durham, is based on a 31x31 subaperture lenslet array and an ANDOR iXon L3CCD60 with 128x128 pixels. A anti-aliasing filter can be inserted in the front focal plane. The SHS can be equipped with two different lenslet arrays providing pixel scales of 0.25'' or 0.5'' for the 4x4 pixel subapertures. The SHS real- time computer (RTC) is an all-CPU architecture."
- 6: "Pyramid WFS: The Pyramid wavefront sensor (PWS), build by Arcetri, have two possible pupil sampling obtained changing the final camera lens namely a low sampling mode with 31x31 subapertures and a high sampling mode with 48x48 subapertures. Any other intermediate sampling between these two could be achieved using a proper camera lens. As the SHS, the PWS is based on the ANDOR iXon L3CCD60."
- 7: "Infrared Test Camera: The ITC is a Hawaii array (1K x 1K) with four contiguous quadrants (512 x 512). The borders of the quadrants are visible in camera images, so the centre of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is usually placed inside one of the quadrants. The cameraâ€™s internal optics are designed to enable a pixel-scale of 5.3 mas/pix. Pixel counts higher than 9000 ADU are considered over-exposed. The read- out noise is below 30 electrons. The ITC has a filter wheel with five different settings: J-band, H-band, K-band, blind, and no filter. The camera is cooled to 103 - 107 K with liquid nitrogen under vacuum conditions of 10-5 to 10-6 mbar for optimal performance. Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) is used as a coolant, and is provided by a standard nitrogen tank which maintains an internal pressure of about 0.6 bar."
