sciencefocus: The high order testbench (HOT) was designed to implements an extreme adaptive optics on a test bench with realistic telescope conditions reproduced by star and turbulence generators. A 32Ã—32 actuator micro deformable mirror (DM), one pyramid wave front sensor, one Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor (SHS), the ESO SPARTA real time computer and an essentially read-noise free L3 CCD60 provide an ideal cocoon to study the different behaviour of the two types of wave front sensors in terms of linearity, sensitivity to calibration errors, noise propagation, specific issues to pyramid or Shack-Hartmann wave front sensors, etc. The main objectives can be summarized as: (1) Study and characterize all the possible limitations which could reduce XAO correction. (2) Characterize two kinds of WFS, Shack-Hartmann and Pyramid, for XAO. Study the different behaviour in terms of linearity, sensitivity to calibration errors and noise propagation. Spatial filtering on the SHS case or modulation for the pyramid, are taken into account. (3) Test bench for new components. New deformable mirrors (MEMS) or EMCCDs are foreseen on next generation XAO systems, as well as new control techniques. It is necessary to check in laboratory their performance and limitations. (4) XAO bench for High contrast techniques. It allows to test and compare the performance of several different types of coronagraphs and new post focal sensing techniques in order to achieve high contrast levels under realistic AO conditions. 
environment: The optical platform is the central structural hub of HOT. The stainless steel table measures 1.5 x 3.5 m and is tapped with the standard M6 screw size on a 25 mm grid. All four "floating" legs of the optical platform have vibration damping servomechanisms that eliminate surrounding floor vibrations. the AO laboratory is also outfitted with two oxygen level sensors that will trigger a local alarm if the oxygen levels in the room drop below 19.0%. 
hardwareitems:
  - 1: Dual source (start+planet).
  - 2: 2 NKT supercontinuum white light lasers.
  - 3: <10 nm rms Au-coated OAPs from Nu Tek (IR compatible).
  - 4: 1 BMC kilo-DM (slot for 2nd kDM).
  - 5: Apodized Vortex Coronagraph (compatible with any 3-plane coronagraphs).
  - 6: Reflective apodizer.
  - 7: Reflective Lyot stop for Lyot-based Low-Order Wavefront Sensing.
  - 8: Andor Neo sCMOS camera.
  - 9: Fiber Injection Unit for High Dispersion Coronagraphy.
