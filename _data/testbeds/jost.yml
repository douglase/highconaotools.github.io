sciencefocus: The JWST Optical Simulation Testbed (JOST) is a tabletop experiment to simulate the main aspects of wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) for a segmented space telescope, including both commissioning and maintenance. JOST has an optical design using three aspheric lenses that reproduces the physics of JWST's three-mirror anastigmat. A segmented deformable mirror stands in for the segmented primary. The optical system provides equivalent sampling and image quality as a JWST NIRCam module, but at HeNe wavelength. With 59 degrees of freedom, we can implement many commissioning activities such as phase retrieval algorithm validation studies with a hexagonally segmented DM, test validation of pupil imaging lens concepts and designs, investigate field-dependence (multiple field point sensing and control), test wavefront control software, and train and develop staff expertise.
environment: JOST is located on a floating table in a class 10000 clean room, in a dark optical enclosure.
hardwareitems:
  - 1: Fiber source as star simulator, monochromatic laser at 638 nm.
  - 2: Steering mirror (tip/tilt) in order to explore a wide field of view.
  - 3: JWST-like pupil mask including the central obscuration and three struts.
  - 4: Three custom lenses in form of a Cooke triplet, i. e. a refracting anastigmat.
  - 5: IrisAO segmented mirror with hexagonal elements each 1.4 mm in diameter (total mirror: 7 mm), in a JWST-like configuration.
  - 6: Pupil imaging lens in order to obtain pupil images of the setup.
  - 7: ZWO ASI1600MM monochrome CMOS camera on a translation rail to allow for focus diversity in the images.

currentstatus: ZWO ASI1600MM monochrome CMOS camera on a translation rail to allow for focus diversity in the images.
software:
  - 1: Python
  - 2: some IDL
shared: Will be shared code with HiCAT in the future.
