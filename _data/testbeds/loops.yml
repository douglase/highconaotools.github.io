sciencefocus: LOOPS is an adaptive optics facility based at LAM. It provides a calibrated environment for research and development on the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PWFS) and Fourier-based Wavefront Sensor (FWFS). Among the topics related to the PWFS, the optical gain variation or the development of new reconstructors are of particular interest. 
environment: The LOOPS tesbed is located in a grey room at LAM. The temperature and humidity are not controlled. An enclosure is planned to be installed on the bench to prevent from dust and parasite light. 
hardwareitems:
- 1: A classical pyramid path using a four-sided monolithic pyramid wavefront sensor. The four sub-pupils are then re-imaged on an OCAM2 camera.
- 2: A Fourier-based warfront sensing path using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) to create any shape of focal phase mask and test new design of WFS. A second OCAM2 camera is used to measure the signal in the pupil plane.
- 3: A Shack-Hartman path to provide a wavefront sensing reference in order to compare the results obtained with the two other WFS.
- 4: An imaging path playing the role of the science camera where the closed-loop PSF is observed and the Sthrel ratio can be computed.

currentstatus: The bench is actually being re-aligned after not having been used for a while. A precise description of the bench (e.g. phase error at pupil planes, NCPA, Strehl ratio) will be presented in a paper in the months to come.
