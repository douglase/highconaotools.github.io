sciencefocus: The laboratory main focus is to develop new technologies for high-contrast imaging for exoplanet imaging and their spectral characterization, testing new advance adaptive optics solutions, higher performing coronagraphs, and KHz visible/NIR focal plane wavefront sensing techniques. The laboratory will deliver end-to-end solutions for upgrading current generation of facility-class instruments, and for future ground- or space-based instruments.
environment: Class 10,000 clean room. Humidity/temperature control. 5'x10' floating air-cushion optical table. Building first floor.
hardwareitems:
  - 1: Infrared low noise C-RED2 camera
  - 2: 468 Alpao DM (baseline, will be using a 277 Alpao at first)
  - 3: HASO
  - 4: Lyot & vortex coronagraphs
  - 5: custom self-coherent camera focal plane mask.

currentstatus: Assembling May/June 2018.
