sciencefocus: SCExAO is a multipurpose and modular instrument and testbed on the Subaru Telescope, performing high-contrast imaging science (exoplanets, disks, dust shells, resolved stars, etc.) as well as testing new technologies (hardware, software, algorithms) for future high-contrast instruments on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes.
environment: SCExAO is installed at the Subaru Telescope, in a fairly stable environment. It can be used on-sky for observations, or as a testbed using various calibration sources (supercontinuum, lasers, tunable filters). The instrument is covered to protect from dust and stray light. The DM is in a sealed chamber to keep the humidity below 15%. The instrument is partially isolated from the Nasmyth Platform using damping feet, reducing laboratory vibrations below 1 mas rms. Various parts of the instrument are motorized, to be fully controller remotely from anywhere.
hardwareitems:
- 1: A star-planet simulator using two fiber sources with different wavelengths is used as the source. An off-axis parabola (OAP) is used to create the collimated beam.
- 2: Two Boston MicroMachine kilo-DMs with 952 active actuators on each are used for wavefront control and estimation.
- 3: The starlight diffraction pattern is modified by a rippled-shaped pupil coronagraph (SPC) and the energy outside of the dark holes is blocked using a bowtie-shaped focal plane mask (FPM).
- 4: A science camera (QSI model RS 6.1s) is placed on a 300mm motorized stage for focal plane imaging and phase retrieval.

currentstatus: SCExAO is open for science at the telescope, mostly using CHARIS and VAMPIRES. The PyWFS delivers Strehl ratios between 80 and 90% routinely now, in good seeing conditions. Recent developments in predictive control showed good results on-sky, improving the correction in high wind-speed conditions. MEC is arriving in March 2018. The fiber injection for IRD will be installed mid-2018. 2 C-RED 2 cameras will be installed before mid-2018, to replace the internal SWIR camera for speckle nulling, and the camera for the LLOWFS. Optimized PIAACMC masks should be installed around the same time. The next engineering observations are planned for the end of June 2018.
