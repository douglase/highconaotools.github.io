sciencefocus: 'Comparison of very high contrast imaging techniques for ground- and space-based telescopes: coronagraphy, apodization, wavefront sensing, DM controls, coherent differential imaging at 1e-9 contrast levels from 500 to 900 nm.'

environment: Clean room, controlled in temperature and humidity.

hardwareitems:
  1: 3 BMC DMs in cascades
  2: one TT mirror
  3: phase masks coronagraphs (FQPM, EOPM, vortex, DZPM, SLPM, and others)
  4: 3 laser diodes (640nm, 700nm, 785nm)
  5: one supercontinuum source (with lots of narrow/broad filters from 500nm to 900nm)

currentstatus: On activity with multiple of collaborations (see website).

software:
  1: Labview for the bench control (motors, DMs, etc)
  2: IDL for calculations

shared: It could be but not sure how useful to another bench it can be.
