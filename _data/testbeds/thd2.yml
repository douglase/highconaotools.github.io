sciencefocus: "Comparison of very high contrast imaging techniques for ground- and space-based telescopes: coronagraphy, apodization, wavefront sensing, DM controls, coherent differential imaging at 1e-9 contrast levels from 500 to 900 nm."
environment: Clean room, controlled in temperature and humidity.
hardwareitems:
  - 1: 3 BMC DMs in cascades
  - 2: one TT mirror
  - 3: phase masks coronagraphs (FQPM, EOPM, vortex, DZPM, SLPM, and others)
  - 4: 3 laser diodes (640nm, 700nm, 785nm)
  - 5: one supercontinuum source (with lots of narrow/broad filters from 500nm to 900nm) 

currentstatus: "On activity with multiple of collaborations see http://thd-bench.lesia.obspm.fr/"
software:
  - 1: Labview for bench control
  - 2: IDL for calculations
shared: It could be but not sure how useful to another bench it can be.
