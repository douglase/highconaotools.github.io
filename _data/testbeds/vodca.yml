sciencefocus: The prime purpose of VODCA is to test and validate manufactured infrared vortex phase masks (and in particular Annular Groove Phase Masks) at the appropriate wavelengths: near- to mid- infrared corresponding to the H, K, L and M bands (1.5 to 4.6 um).
environment: VODCA is located in a ISO 7 clean room (class 10000). The optical bench sits on an active vibration isolation system.
hardwareitems:
  - 1: supercontinuum laser source delivering single-mode broadband beam from approx. 1.5 to 4 um.
  - 2: infrared InSb camera from FLIR, cooled to 77K and operating in the 1.5-5.5um wavelength range
  - 3: ALPAO deformable mirror with 97 actuators
  - 4: QCL laser producing a single-mode narrow-line emission at around 4.6 um

currentstatus: In operation. The bench allows to reach the intrinsic on-axis rejection limit of the manufactured Annular Groove Phase Masks (up to a few 1000:1 in broad L-band).
software:
  - 1: Python
  - 2: Labview
