sciencefocus: 'The prime purpose of VODCA is to test and validate manufactured infrared vortex phase masks (and in particular Annular Groove Phase Masks) at the appropriate wavelengths: near- to mid- infrared corresponding to the H, K, L and M bands (1.5 to 4.6 um).'

environment: VODCA is located in a ISO 7 clean room (class 10000). The optical bench sits on an active vibration isolation system.

hardwareitems:
  1: supercontinuum laser source delivering single-mode broadband beam from approx. 1.5 to 4 um.
  2: infrared InSb camera from FLIR, cooled to 77K and operating in the 1.5-5.5um wavelength range
  3: ALPAO deformable mirror with 97 actuators
  4: QCL laser producing a single-mode narrow-line emission at around 4.6 um

currentstatus: '<p>In operation. The bench allows to reach the intrinsic on-axis rejection limit of the manufactured Annular Groove Phase Masks (up to a few 1000:1 in broad L-band).</p>
<p>Future of the bench: 1) testing of newly manufactured AGPM, 2) new apodization and wavefront sensing techniques, 3) charge 4 and beyond vortices testing.</p>'

software:
  1: Python
  2: Labview

shared: Not currently but could be if useful.
