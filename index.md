# Welcome to the high contrast testbed community homepage!

The purpose of this website is to provide a sustainable, open-source repository of information on the capabilities of 
high contrast testbeds around the world. By creating a hub for testbed descriptions, code links, events, and news, we 
hope to facilitate resource-sharing and new collaborations.

All are invited to add and update information about their labs on the testbeds page by opening a pull request on the 
website'd GitHub repository.

For more information about the idea behind this, check out our [About](/about.html) section.
